# Phys 150 - Engineering for the Modern World

This repository will hold examples and reference codes for Winona State University's Phys 150 class.

## CircuitPython Examples
Navigate to the relevant week and find examples that will help you learn and tackle the assignments.
If you get stuck trying to do something, there may be an example to help you out.
These examples are pretty basic, but have challenge questions at the end (in comments) to help you build off them.
